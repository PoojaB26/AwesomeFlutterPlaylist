# Contribution Guidelines

This project is built keeping beginners in mind, so I'm trying to collect good and great tutorials and putting them in separate categories for easier find. However, intermediate and advanced tutorials are also welcome. 

Before you contribute, please keep the following guidelines in mind. 

- Only provide resources that are a learning material. Video tutorials, articles, or blogs and repos. Materials that are just code, without any explanation will be rejected. 

- Your commit description (and your PR title) should have the following format: "Added <max 5 words summary of link> under <Category>" 
And add the link to your resource in the extra description box. 

*E.g "Added ML Kit Face Detection under Firebase"* and link in description.


- If you have a new category to add that is not present at the moment, kindly add it at the end of all the categories but *before* **Flutter Snippets**. Dont change the format of the table, it will be rejected. 

E.g

category1 <br>
category2 <br>
category.. <br>
**YOUR NEW CATEGORY** <br>
Flutter Snippets <br>
Other Blogs <br>

- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.

- Check your spelling and grammar.

Thank you for your contribution!
